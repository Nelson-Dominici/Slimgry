# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch

Separating new features or enhancements into distinct feature branches and submitting a pull request for each branch is highly crucial. This enables me to assess and merge new features or improvements on an individual basis.

## Style Guide

Try as much as possible to follow the recommendations of the [PSR-12 standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).

## Unit Testing

Each pull request needs to be supported by successful unit tests and comprehensive code coverage, use [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/index.html).
